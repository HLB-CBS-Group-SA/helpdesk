// "Default", with per-type fields shown via depends_on), and Subject's label and
// placeholder were hardcoded here. Software Requests needed Subject to BE the
// software name — so the request is readable in the ticket list — without a
// second "Software / tool name" field duplicating it, and without renaming
// Subject for Operational Incidents, HR Onboarding and the rest.
//
// Keyed on the HD Ticket Type name, so adding a type here is a one-line change.
// Anything not listed keeps the upstream wording untouched.
//
// Strings are stored raw and passed through __() at read time, not at module
// load, so translations resolve after the locale is ready.
// HLB-FORK: editor-hint — per-SUB-TYPE placeholder for the body editor.
// Retiring narrative custom fields ("Alternatives considered", "What do you need
// added or changed?") moved that prose into the body, so the body has to ask for
// it. Upstream's placeholder is the single word-pair "Detailed explanation" for
// every ticket in the system.
//
// Keyed on the sub-type VALUE rather than on (type, field): those values are
// already unique across the whole form — they are what the SLA conditions and
// the routing table match on — so a flat map needs no second lookup and stays

  // HLB-FORK: validate-visible — only demand what the form actually drew.
  //
  // `visibleFields` is the whole template, not the visible part of it: the
  // hiding happens one level down, in UniInput's own
  // `v-if="field.display_via_depends_on"`. Filtering on `required` alone
  // therefore demands fields that are not on screen, and names them in an
  // error the person has no way to act on. On 2026-08-25 a single stray
  // `required: 1` on a Project & Innovation template row blocked submission of
  // EVERY ticket type this way — "Fieldwork completion date is required" on a
  // printer request. The config half is fixed in company_helpdesk; this is the
  // half that made one bad row an outage instead of a stray asterisk.
  //
  // `description` had the same shape of bug: it was unconditional here while
  // the Submit button already honoured `bodyRequired`, so an Offboarding
  // ticket — where optional-body deliberately allows an empty body — offered
  // an enabled button and then refused the submit.
  // See customisations.manifest.json id=ui-validate-visible.
